                <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
                <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: 3/31/2025</p>
                
                <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of this website and its digital products. By purchasing or accessing any content from this platform, you agree to be legally bound by these Terms.</p>

                <h2>1. Digital Products and License Distribution</h2>
                <p>All products offered through this website are digital in nature. Upon purchase, license keys and/or access credentials are automatically generated and delivered electronically. These licenses are <strong>non-shareable</strong>, intended solely for <strong>personal use</strong>, and are <strong>bound to the user's unique hardware ID</strong>. Redistribution, resale, or sharing of license keys is strictly prohibited.</p>

                <h2>2. No Refund Policy</h2>
                <p>Due to the irreversible nature of digital product delivery and the automatic issuance of license keys, <strong>all sales are final</strong>. Once a digital product has been delivered, it is considered used and cannot be refunded, exchanged, or canceled under any circumstances.</p>

                <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and ensuring that your credentials and license keys are not shared or misused. Unauthorized duplication or distribution will result in immediate revocation of access, without refund.</p>

                <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>All content and digital products provided through this website remain the intellectual property of their respective owners. No material may be copied, reproduced, modified, or distributed in any form without express written permission.</p>

                <h2>5. Tax Responsibility</h2>
                <p>It is the user's sole responsibility to determine and fulfill any applicable tax obligations in their jurisdiction, including but not limited to sales tax, use tax, value-added tax (VAT), or customs duties. We do not collect or remit taxes on behalf of users unless legally required.</p>

                <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>We are not liable for any damages, malfunctions, or losses resulting from the misuse of our products or from their interaction with a user's system. Although the risk of such issues is minimal, due to the varying nature of individual PC configurations, unexpected outcomes may occur. By purchasing and using our digital products, the user accepts full responsibility for any issues or damages that may arise. The user agrees to these terms as a condition of completing the transaction.</p>

                <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
                <p>These Terms and any disputes arising out of or related to them will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in New Castle County, Delaware.</p>

                <h2>8. Modifications to Terms</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms at any time without prior notice. Continued use of our services after any changes have been posted constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>

                <h2>9. Unauthorized Use, Reverse Engineering, and Redistribution</h2>
                <p>Any attempt to tamper with, decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, modify, bypass license mechanisms, or otherwise interfere with the integrity of the software is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, the creation or distribution of cracked versions, unauthorized derivatives, or modified builds of the product for personal use, public distribution, or resale.</p>
                
                <p>The unauthorized reproduction, alteration, or redistribution of the software—whether for commercial gain or free access—constitutes a direct violation of applicable intellectual property and copyright laws.</p>
                
                <p>Violators may be subject to immediate termination of access, civil liability for damages, and, where applicable, criminal prosecution under local and international intellectual property statutes. We reserve the right to pursue all available legal remedies to the fullest extent permitted by law against individuals or entities found engaging in such activities.</p>
